# Overview

This project is for solving simple sudoku boards. I have had this idea in the back of my head for a while and I am excited that I can finally make it. For this project, I wanted to challenge myself by programming in Rust. I have never done a full project in Rust so I knew there would be some issues and growing pains. Secondly, I didn't want to use any outside help for the algorithm, so I developed everything inside the program without outside knowledge, so there may be flaws that I didn't realize.

# Development Environment

This project was exclusively done in Rust with the Rust Rover IDE from JetBrains. I am very unfamiliar with Rust projects so that will be the largest challenge.

# Useful Websites and Resources

I only used this website for testing and the Rust documentation website

-https://sudoku.com/
-https://www.rust-lang.org/learn

# Future Ideas


  - Predictive analysis, as of now the program cant solve problems without a definitive solution, there is go guessing and checking.
  - Some API features so I could connect it to a website and have it automatically solve Sudoku.
